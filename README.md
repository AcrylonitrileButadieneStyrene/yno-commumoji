# YNO Commumojis
Unofficial community created emojis for [YNO](ynoproject.net)

## Installation
1. Add a userscript manager extension (e.g. 
    [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
    ([Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)
    / [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao)
    / [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey)))
2. Install [the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AcrylonitrileButadieneStyrene/yno-commumoji/master/yno-commumoji.user.js)
    - Opening the link should open an installation dialog.
      
      If it does not then manually create a new script and paste the contents into it.
3. Reload YNO if it is already opened

## Usage
- Commumojis start with a `-` in their names (e.g. `:-emoji:`)
  to not cause collisions in the future and to indicate them as 3rd party
- The list of Commumojis tries to update daily.
- The last update time can be seen inside of the userscript manager's extension UI.
  - Clicking on it will force a refresh.
    Do not do this too often or you will be rate-limited.
- Only you and other players with the script installed can see the Commumojis!
